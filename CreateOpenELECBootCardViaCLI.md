## Create the Booting TF Card

**Get the device node of TF card:**

After you've inserted the TF card to your PC, use `dmesg | tail` to find out what /dev/device it is. 
You can also use `parted` or `fdisk`, It should be something like /dev/sdX:
```sh
$ sudo parted -l
...
Model: Mass Storage Device (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 3997MB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
 1      16.5MB  3989MB  3973MB  primary  fat32        boot
```

**Make sure the disk is unmounted:**
```sh
$ umount /dev/sdb1
```

**Use `dd` to write the disk image into TF card:**
```sh
sudo dd if=Vim_LibreELEC_V161003/update.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M && sync
```
*Notice: `sync` is ensure the changes are synced to the TF card before removing it.*


**Eject the TF card:**
```sh
$ sudo eject /dev/sdb
```

Done. Now you can insert the TF card into Vim, and enjoy the OpenELEC!
