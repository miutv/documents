# Howto Boot Erase the onboard EMMC Storage

There are many different ways to wipe out all the data on EMMC, and list as following:

### Keys Mode(U-Boot is running)
1. Power on Vim.
2. Long press `Power` and `Function` buttons simultaneously without release
3. Short press ‘Reset’ key and release
4. After the operations above, the system will begin to earse automately, and it will take around 10 seconds to done that.
5. The display/monitor will display as a black screen when the wiping process is done.


### Serial Mode(For developers)
1. Refer this [guidance](https://github.com/miutv/documents/blob/master/SetupSerialTool.md) to setup serial tool for Vim.
2. Make sure again you've done the right connections and setup.
3. Hit any keys at the moment of booting to stop autoboot. This step will let Vim boot into u-boot mode.
4. Type `store init 3` on the terminal of u-boot, and wait the wiping process to complete.
5. Type `reboot` or press the `Reset` button
6. References as following:
```

### Breaking Mode
1. Do normal upgrading. [USB-C cable mode](https://github.com/miutv/documents/blob/master/UpgradeViaUSBCable.md) or [TF card burning card mode](https://github.com/miutv/documents/blob/master/UpgradeViaTFBurningCard.md).
2. Break out during the upgrade process(break after 15% process is recommended), for example, plug-out the USB-C cable or the TF card.
3. Power on Vim again, and you'll find all the data on EMMC have been wiped out.
